##  Project Aim üéØ
The objective of this project was to leverage data analytics techniques to form a representative Playing XI by analyzing players from all participating teams in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2022. The project involved extracting player and match data through web scraping from the ESPN Cricinfo website, transforming and analyzing the data using Python and Pandas, and building interactive dashboards in Power BI. Advanced data modeling and calculations were performed using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to support insightful visualizations and data-driven selections.

# Steps involved in the project:
## Data Collection and Web Scraping
Data was collected from the ESPN Cricinfo website using a custom web scraper designed to efficiently extract comprehensive information, including match details, results, player batting statistics, and bowling performance data. The extracted data was systematically stored in JSON format for streamlined processing and further analysis.

## Data Transformation and Conversion
Utilized Python and the Pandas library to clean and transform the JSON data into a structured and analysis-ready format. The processed data was then imported into Excel, where further cleaning and preparation were performed using Power Query. This ensured the data was well-structured for efficient table relationships and accurate data modeling.

## Visualization Using Power BI Dashboard
The processed data was initially imported into Excel for further cleaning and preparation using Power Query, ensuring it was well-structured for efficient table relationships and accurate data modeling. Subsequently, the cleaned data was imported into Power Query in the Power BI, where additional cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query.
Data modeling was then conducted to establish relationships between tables, enabling coherent and comprehensive analysis.
Dynamic dashboards were created featuring interactive charts and visualizations that highlighted key metrics such as Openers, middle-order, and fast bowlers. These dashboards provided actionable insights into player performances, team strengths, and potential areas for improvement.

## Selecting the Best Playing 11
Employed data-driven analysis and informed decision-making to assemble the best playing 11, guided by the insights derived from the dashboard. The selected lineup emphasizes strong batting capabilities with the potential to score over 200 runs, coupled with a disciplined bowling attack designed to restrict the opposition to under 150 runs, ensuring a well-balanced and competitive team composition
